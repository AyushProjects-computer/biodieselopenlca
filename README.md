- Biodiesel Lipase process model
- Input-output inventory
- Impact assessment results (IPCC 2013 GWP100a)
- Documentation and summary report

## Software & Database
- openLCA v2.5.0 (GreenDelta)
- ELCD v3.2 (correction 20220908)
- Impact Method: IPCC 2013 GWP 100a

## Functional Unit
1 kg of biodiesel (FAME)

## System Boundary

## Highlights
- Total GWP: ~3.4–3.5 kg CO₂ eq/kg biodiesel
- Hotspots: Vegetable oil and enzyme production
- Improvement suggestions: renewable electricity, waste oil feedstock, enzyme reuse
